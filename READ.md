## Things im learning
---
* **deconstructing**:  
    Meaning when you would like a bunch of variable or keyNames in an object and would like to easily grab them by name instead of using Dot notation 
* **API**:  
    meaning Aplication Programming Inviroment.
    Api's are used as the carrier inbetween systems to use things such as CRUD
* **CRUD**:  
    Meaning Create,Read,Update,Delete:  
    1. Create- Post
    2. Read - Get
    3. Update- Put
    4. Delete- Delete
* **async**:  
    Meaning basic j.s reads top to bottom, where as async j.s reads top to bottom but pulls the function out from the stack like peices of jenga then restacks them when j.s has finished loading

* **promises**:  
    GOD i hate them.  
    Meaning they create Asyn actions which allow you to wait untill called.  
    They accept two states a resolve and a reject.  
    if the resolve goes through it will use a  
     **.then( ()=>{} )**  
    otherwise they use a   
    **.catch(()=>{})**
* **Fetch()**:  
    GOD i love it.  
    Meaning to get data to and from the server using CRUD.  
    They also return a promise
* **callbacks**:  
    Meaning to use a function to callback( ) another function, then it is passed into the peramitors and brought back as an annomimous function or a fat arrow function then inside of the fatarrow you use the item inside the peramitors to handle the info  
    They are terrible DO NOT USE THEM
